# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The Measuring Network Quality for End-Users workshop {{WORKSHOP}} was
held virtually by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in
September 14-16, 2021.  This report summarizes the workshop, the topics
discussed, and some preliminary conclusions drawn at the end of the
workshop.

## Problem space

The Internet in 2021 is quite different from what it was 10 years
ago. Today, it is a crucial part of everyoneâs daily life. People use
the Internet for their social life, for their daily jobs, for routine
shopping, and for keeping up with major events. An increasing number
of people can access a Gigabit connection, which would be hard to
imagine a decade ago. And, thanks to improvements in security, people
trust the Internet for both planning their finances and for everyday
payments.

At the same time, some aspects of end-user experience have not
improved as much. Many users have typical connection latency that
remains at decade-old levels. Despite significant reliability
improvements in data center environments, end users often see
interruptions in service. Despite algorithmic advances in the field of
control theory, one can often find that the queuing delay in the
last-mile equipment exceeds the accumulated transit delay. Transport
improvements, such as QUIC, Multipath TCP, and TCP Fast Open are still
not fully supported in some networks. Likewise, various advances in
the security and privacy of user data are not widely supported, such
as encrypted DNS to the local resolver.

Some of the major factors behind this lack of progress is the popular
perception that throughput is the often sole measure of the quality of
Internet connectivity. With such narrow focus, the workshop aimed to
discuss various questions:

- What is the latency under typical working conditions?
- How reliable is the connectivity across longer time periods?
- Does the network allow the use of a broad range of protocols?
- What services can be run by clients of the network?
- What kind of IPv4, NAT, or IPv6 connectivity is offered, and are
  there firewalls?
- What security mechanisms are available for local services, such as
  DNS?
- To what degree are the privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and
  authenticity of user communications guarded?
- Improving these aspects of network quality will likely depend on
  measurement and exposing metrics to all involved parties, including
  to end users in a meaningful way. Such measurements and exposure of
  the right metrics will allow service providers and network operators
  to focus on the aspects that impacts the usersâ experience most and
  at the same time empowers users to choose the Internet service that
  will give them the best experience.
- What are the fundamental properties of a network that contribute to good user experience?
- What metrics quantify these properties, and how to collect such metrics in a practical way?
- What are the best practices for interpreting those metrics, and incorporating those in a decision making process?
- What are the best ways to communicate these properties to service providers and network operators?
- How can these metrics be displayed to users in a meaningful way?

# Discussions {#discussions}

The three day workshop was broken into four separate sections,
including introductory material and conclusions, that each played a
role in framing the discussions.

## Introduction and overviews

The Introduction section allowed participants to introduce and discuss
the problem space, existing mechanisms for QoS and QoE measurements.
Also discussed was the interaction between multiple users within the
Network, as well as the interaction between multiple layers of the OSI
stack.  Some existing measurement works were presented.  Vint Cerf
provided a key note describing the history and importance of
the topic.

## Metrics considerations

The Metrics section of the workshop concentrated on both defining new
and existing measures and how they might apply to different sections
of the Internet.  The need for improvements to latency and its
measurements was heavily discussed, especially for certain classes of
users such as live, collaborative content and gaming.

With the onset of COVID-19, the global population became more dependent on
vairous forms of collaboration and telepresence to get their work.

The metrics for network quality can be roughly grouped into:

1. Availability metrics, which indicate whether the user can access the network
   at all.
2. Capacity metrics, which indicate whether the actual line capacity is
   sufficient to meet the user demands.
3. Latency metrics, which indicate whether the user gets the data in time.
4. Higher-order metrics, which include both the network metrics, such as
   inter-packet arrival time, and the applicaiton metrics, such as the mean
   time between rebuffering for video streaming.

The availabiltiy metrics can be seen as derivative of either the capacity (zero
capacity leading to zero availability) or the latency (infinite latency
leading to zero availability).

Finally, the best metrics are those that are actionable.

### Availability metrics
TBD:

- Was the line down and for how long?
- Was the line unstable and for how long?

### Capacity metrics

If the network capacity does not meet the user demands, the network quality
will be impacted. Once the capacity meets the demands, increasing capacity
won't lead to further quality improvements.

The actual network connection capacity is determined by the equipment and the
lines along the network path, and it varies throughout the day and across
mutliple days. Studies involving DSL lines in North America indicate that over
30% of the DSL lines have capacity metrics that vary by more than 10%
throughout the day and accross multiple days.

Some factors that affect the actual capacity are:
1. Presence of a competing traffic, either in the LAN or in the WAN
   environments. In the LAN setting, the competing traffic reflects the
   multiple devices that share the Internet connection. In the WAN setting the
   competing traffic often originates from the unrelated network flows that
   happen to share the same network path.
2. Capabilities of the equipment along the path of the network connection,
   including the data transfer rate and the amount of memory used for
   buffering.
3. Active traffic management measures, such as traffic shapers and policers
   that are often used by the network providers.

There are other factors that can negatively affect the actual line capacities.

The user demands of the traffic follow the usage patterns and preferences of
the particular users. For example, large data transfers can use any available
capacity, while the media streaming applicaitons require limited capacity to
function correclty. Video-conferencing applications typically need less
capacity than high-definition video streaming.

### Latency metrics

End-to-end latency is the time it takes for a particular segment to traverse
the entire network path from the user to their destionation. The end-to-end
latency comprises several components:

1. The propagation delay, which reflects the path distance and the individual
   link technologies (e.g. fibre vs satellite). The propagation doesn't depend
   on the utilization of the network, to the extent that the network path
   remains constant.
2. The buffering delay, which reflects the time segments spend in the memory of
   the network equipment that connect the individual network links, as well as
   in the memory of the transmitting endpoint. The buffering delay depends on
   the network utilization, as well as on the algorithms that govern the queued segments.
3. The transport protocol delays, which reflects the time spent in
   retransmission and reassembly, as well as the time spent when the transport
   is "head-of-line blocked."
4. Some of the workshop sumbissions have explicitly called out the application
   delay, which reflects the inefficiencies in the application layer.

Tradionally, end-to-end latency is measured with tools such as {{tools.ping}}, as
well as with services such as {{tools.ookla_speedtest}}.
Such measurements are typically performed when the network is idle, and as a
result, such measurements reflect mostly the propagation delay.

A different way to measure the end-to-end latency is to perform the test when
the network is not idle, but in its typical working conditions.

The workshop participants used the term "Idle latency" when referring to the
subject of the former measurement methods, and "Working latency" when referring
to the latter.

While historically the tooling available for measuring latency focused on
measuring the idle latency, there is a trend in the industry to start measuring
the working latency as well, e.g. {{tools.apple_networkQuality}}.

### Measurement methodologies

The participants have proposed several concrete methodologies for measuring the
network quality for the end users.

{{Paasch2021}} introduced a new dimensionless metric, called RPM
(which stands for "round-trips per minute"), to communicate the quality of the
network to the end users. The metric represents the number of round trips a
segment can make within a minute when the network is under its typical working
conditions. The RPM metric reflects the combination of the propagation delay,
the buffering delay and the transport protocol delays. The RPM metric is designed
to be easy to explain to the general public - the higher values reflect better
network conditions, and the typical values are 3-4 digits.

{{Mathis2021}} have applied the RPM metric to the results of more than 4
billion download tests that were performed by M-Lab betwen 2010 and 2021.
During this timeframe, the measurement platform that M-Lab uses underwent
several upgrades, which allowed the research team to compare different versions
of the TCP CCAs. The study have demonstrated that the Cubic CCA have lowered
the responsiveness, which is attributed to the fact that Cubic uses large
network queues to maximize throughput.  A subsequent upgrade to the BBR CCA
have demonstrated increased responsivness (with the exception of several
locations such as NYC), which is consitent with the BBR design that makes
efforts to estimate the network capacity better, and relies on the capacity
estimations and pacing to maximize the throuhgput, vs. large queues.

The study have demonstrated that aside from the platform upgrades, the reported
RPM values are similar between the adjacent months, which suggests that the RPM
metric is stable. Changes in RPM metric that could not be attributed to changes
in the M-Lab platform were found to be consistent and lasting for several
months, which suggests that these were caused by ISPs upgrading their
equipment, or other events to the similar effect.

{{Schlinker2019}} presented a large scale study of the correlation between the
goodput and the quality of the experience of users of a large social network.

The authors performed the measurements at multiple datacenters from which video
segmetns of a set size were streamed to a large number of end users. The
authors used "the probability of transmitting vvideo segment of size S at
goodput G" as the metric. Goodput is highly dependent on the transport delays,
but is less sensitive to the latency. Further, the goodput is highly dependent
on the choice of the transport protocol (the authors used QUIC with BBRv1.)

Specifically, the authors suggested using the probabilty of
achieving desired goodput G when transmitting object of set size S.

TODO: insert formula

The choice of goodput and the logicistical metric were driven by the need to
assess the maximal quality of the content that can be effectively served by the
network. Specifically, the suggested metric has several properties that are
desireable for operators of large scale video streaming service:

1. The suggested metric is easy to aggregate, and therefore can be used to
   reflect the network quality across multiple connections - up to the scale of
   entire autonomous systems.
2. The suggested metric is directly applicable to the operators of streaming
   media services, since it allows to choose the most appropriate compression
   algorithms and bitrates to achieve the highest quality for a given network
   connection (or an aggregate, such as AS), without significant degradation of
   goodput.

The study have found that the short video clips, which constitute the majority
of the traffic, are typically consumed in a sequential way. Since the
sequential consumption of video is less sensitive to the buffering delays than
random-access consumption, the goodput metric may not be as sensitive to the
buffering delay as the RPM metric. It is, however, influenced by all types of
delay, and in particular is useful for identifying infrstructure nodes that are
shared by multiple forms of traffic.

As such, the suggested metric seems highly valuable to the operators of
streaming services, either when estimated the needed network capacity, or when
deciding what bitrate values to use in order to deliver the content at the
highest quality without stretching the capacity of the network.


{{Reed2021}} presents the results of FCC's "Measuring the Broadband America" (MBA) study.
### RPM metric considerations

The workshop participants have agreed that the RPM metric is an effective way
to communicate the network quality to the end users.

There's remaining work to be done before the RPM metric can be used as an
industry standard:

- The use of natural traffic vs. synthetic traffic.

The RPM metric, as defined in {{Paasch2021}}, relies on synthetic traffic to
bring the network into the working conditions.

There are pros and cons of the use of the synthetic traffic when compared to
the natural traffic that's generated by the applications which the end user
runs.

Using natural traffic to measure the responsiveness of the network is more
reflective of the interactions of users with the specific application.
Additionally, utilizing natural traffic to measure the network responsiveness
does not consume any additional resources beyond what is required by the
applications. Finally, using the natural traffic minimizes any potential impact
of the measurement on other applications.

Using the synthetic traffic to measure the responsiveness has the benefit of
reliably assessing the responsiveness when used by any particular applicaiton,
or by multiple applicaitons at once. The results of responsiveness
test that utilizes synthetic traffic allow comparing different
equipment or different locaitons in a fair way. Additionally, using a
synthetic traffic makes it easier to standardize the responsiveness
test - both the specific protocols that are used, as well as the test dynamics.
Finally, the use of active measurement alleviates the privacy concerns
that may arise if the users were not aware that their activities are used
to measure the quality of the network.

Work remains on making the RPM methodology more robust, as well as on
reconciling the two fundamental ways of measuring the network responsivenes.
This work had been taken to the IPPM working group within the IETF.

The workshop participants believe that it would be valuable to develop
methodology which could be used by the community to reconcile the RPM metric
with the goodput metric.

### Metrics considerations - conclusions

Through the course of the workshop, the following statements have emerged:

Both the goodput and the latency are important to measure. Today, users in many
locations around the world have access to gigabit throughput, and measuring the
latency is more important for these. Otehr users can not (yet) benefit from the
high-bandwidth network access. For these users, both throughput and latency
should be measured.

When measuring the latency, one should measure the latency under typical
working conditions, since the idle latency is not a good estimator of the user
experience. Data shows that there is dramatic difference between the idle
latency and the working latency. The RPM metric, described in {{Paasch2021}}
is one way to communicate the working latency to the users.

Most of existing tools today focus on measuring idle latency. It is important
to continue invsesting into a standard methodology (and a toolkit) to make
it possible for anyone to measure the working latency.


## Cross-layer considerations

In the Cross-layer section participants presented material and discussed
how accurately measuring exactly where problems occur is difficult
when many components of a network connection can affect the
measurement.  Discussion centered especially on the differences
between physically wired and wireless connections and the difficulties
of accurately determining problem spots when multiple different
network types are responsible for the quality.

## Synthesis

Finally, in the Synthesis section presentations and discussions
concentrated on the next steps likely needed to make forward
progress. Of particular concern is how to bring forward measurements
that can make sense to end users trying to make subscription
decisions.

# Conclusions

During the final hour of the workshop we gathered statements that the
group thought were summary statements from the 3 day event.  We later
discarded any that were in contention (listed further below for
completeness).  For this document, the editor took the original list
and divided it into rough categories, applied some suggested edits
discussed on the mailing list and further edited for clarity and to
provide context.

## General statements

1. Bandwidth is necessary but not alone sufficient.
2. In many cases, Internet users donât need more bandwidth, but rather
   need "better bandwidth" -- i.e., they need other improvements to
   their connectivity.
3. We need both active and passive measurements â passive measurements
   can provide historical debugging.
4. We need passive measurements to be continuous and archivable and
   queriable â include reliability/connectivity measurements.
5. A really meaningful metric for users is whether their application
   will work properly or fail because of a lack of a network with
   sufficient characteristics.
6. A useful metric for goodness must actually incentive goodness --
   good metrics should be actionable to help drive industries toward
   improvement.
7. A lower latency Internet, however achieved would benefit all end
   users.

## Specific statements about detailed protocols/techniques

8. Round trips Per Minute (RPM) is a useful, consumable metric.
9. We need a usable tool that fills the current gap between network
   reachability, latency, and speed tests.
10. End-users that want to be involved in QoS decisions should be able
    to voice their needs and desires.
11. Applications are needed that can perform and report good quality
    measurements in order to identify insufficient points in
    network access.
12. Research done by regulators indicate that users/consumers prefer
    a simple metric per application, which frequently resolves to
    whether the application will work properly or not.
13. New measurements and QoS or QoE techniques should not rely only or
    depend on reading TCP headers.
10. It is clear from developers of interactive applications and from
    network operators that lower latency is a strong factor in user
    QoE.  However, metrics are lacking to support this statement
    directly.

## Problem statements and concerns

15. Latency mean and medians are distractions from better measurements.
16. It is frustrating to only measure network services without
    simultaneously improving those services.
17. Stakeholder incentives arenât aligned for easy wins in this space.
    Incentives are needed to motivate improvements in public network
    access.  Measurements may be one step toward driving competitive
    market incentive.
18. For future-proof networking, it is important to measure the
    ecological impact of material and energy usage.
19. We do not have incontrovertible evidence that any one metric
    (e.g., latency or speed) is more important than others to persuade
    device vendors to concentrate on any one optimization.

## No-consensus reached statements

Additional statements were recorded that did not have consensus of the
group at the time, but we list them here for completeness about the fact
they were discussed:

1. We do not have incontrovertible evidence that buffer bloat is a
   prevalent problem.
2. The measurement needs to support reporting localization in order to
   find problems.  Specifically:
    - Detecting a problem is not sufficient if you canât find the location.
    - Need more than just English â different localization concerns.
3. Stakeholder incentives arenât aligned for easy wins in this space.

# Follow-on work

There was discussion during the workshop about where future work
should be performed.  The group agreed that some work could be done
more immediately within existing IETF working groups (e.g. IPPM,
DetNet and RAW), while other longer-term research may be needed in
IRTF groups.

# Security considerations

A few security relevant topics were discussed at the workshop,
including but not limited to:

- What prioritization techniques can work without invading the privacy
  of the communicating parties.
- How oversubscribed networks can essentially be viewed as a DDoS
  attack.
