# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The Measuring Network Quality for End-Users workshop {{WORKSHOP}} was
held virtually by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in
September 14-16, 2021.  This report summarizes the workshop, the topics
discussed, and some preliminary conclusions drawn at the end of the
workshop.

## Problem space

The Internet in 2021 is quite different from what it was 10 years
ago. Today, it is a crucial part of everyoneâs daily life. People use
the Internet for their social life, for their daily jobs, for routine
shopping, and for keeping up with major events. An increasing number
of people can access a Gigabit connection, which would be hard to
imagine a decade ago. And, thanks to improvements in security, people
trust the Internet for both planning their finances and for everyday
payments.

At the same time, some aspects of end-user experience have not
improved as much. Many users have typical connection latency that
remains at decade-old levels. Despite significant reliability
improvements in data center environments, end users often see
interruptions in service. Despite algorithmic advances in the field of
control theory, one can often find that the queuing delay in the
last-mile equipment exceeds the accumulated transit delay. Transport
improvements, such as QUIC, Multipath TCP, and TCP Fast Open are still
not fully supported in some networks. Likewise, various advances in
the security and privacy of user data are not widely supported, such
as encrypted DNS to the local resolver.

Some of the major factors behind this lack of progress is the popular
perception that throughput is the often sole measure of the quality of
Internet connectivity. With such narrow focus, the workshop aimed to
discuss various questions:

- What is the latency under typical working conditions?
- How reliable is the connectivity across longer time periods?
- Does the network allow the use of a broad range of protocols?
- What services can be run by clients of the network?
- What kind of IPv4, NAT, or IPv6 connectivity is offered, and are
  there firewalls?
- What security mechanisms are available for local services, such as
  DNS?
- To what degree are the privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and
  authenticity of user communications guarded?
- Improving these aspects of network quality will likely depend on
  measurement and exposing metrics to all involved parties, including
  to end users in a meaningful way. Such measurements and exposure of
  the right metrics will allow service providers and network operators
  to focus on the aspects that impacts the usersâ experience most and
  at the same time empowers users to choose the Internet service that
  will give them the best experience.
- What are the fundamental properties of a network that contribute to good user experience?
- What metrics quantify these properties, and how to collect such metrics in a practical way?
- What are the best practices for interpreting those metrics, and incorporating those in a decision making process?
- What are the best ways to communicate these properties to service providers and network operators?
- How can these metrics be displayed to users in a meaningful way?

# Workshop Agenda

# Discussions {#discussions}

The three day workshop was broken into four separate sections,
including introductory material and conclusions, that each played a
role in framing the discussions.

## Introduction and overviews

The Introduction section allowed participants to introduce and discuss
the problem space, existing mechanisms for QoS and QoE measurements.
Also discussed was the interaction between multiple users within the
Network, as well as the interaction between multiple layers of the OSI
stack.  Some existing measurement works were presented.  Vint Cerf
provided a key note describing the history and importance of
the topic.

## Metrics considerations {#discussion-metrics}

The Metrics section of the workshop concentrated on both defining new
and existing measures and how they might apply to different sections
of the Internet.  The need for improvements to latency and its
measurements was heavily discussed, especially for certain classes of
users such as live, collaborative content and gaming.


## Cross-layer considerations {#discussion-cross-layer}

In the Cross-layer section participants presented material and discussed
how accurately measuring exactly where problems occur is difficult
when many components of a network connection can affect the
measurement.  Discussion centered especially on the differences
between physically wired and wireless connections and the difficulties
of accurately determining problem spots when multiple different
network types are responsible for the quality.

The participants have agreed that no single component of a network connection
has all the data to be able to measure the effects of the network performance
on the quality of the end user experience.

- The applications that are running on the end-user devices have the best
  insight into their respective performance, but have limited visibility into
  the behavior of the network, and are not able to act on the limited information
  about the network performance.
- The Internet service providers have good insight into the QoS considerations,
  but are not able to infer the effect of the QoS metrics on the quality of the
  end user experience.
- The content providers have good insight into the aggregated behavior of the
  end users, but lack the insight on what aspects of the network performance
  are the leading indicators of the users behavior.

The workshop had identified the need for a standard and extensible way to
exchange the network performance. Such exchnage standard should address the
folowing aspects:

- Scalable way to capture the performance of multiple (potentially thousandsof) endpoints.
- Accompanying set of tools to analyze the data.
- A transparent model for giving the different actors on the network connection
  an incentive to share the performance data they collect.
- Prservation of the privacy of the end users. In particular, federated
  learning approaches, where no centralized entity has the access to the whole
  picture, are preferred.
- The data exchange format should include precautions against data
  manipulations, so that the different actors won't be tempted to game the
  mechanism.

### Separation of concerns

Commonly, there's a tight coupling between 
a. collecting performance metrics,
b. interpreteting those metrics and 
c. acting upon the intrepretation of the metrics.

Unfortunately, such model is not the best for achieving exchange of the
cross-layer data:
- The actors that have the ability to collect particular performance metrics
  (e.g. the TCP RTT) do not necessarily have the context necessary for a
  meaningful interpretation.
- The actors that have the context and the computational/storage capacity for
  the interpretation do not necessarily have the abilty to control the behavior
  of network / application.
- The actors that can control the behavior of network / application typically
  do not have access to the data. 

The participatns have agreed that it is important to separate the above three
aspects, so that:
- The different actors that have the data but not the ability to interpret /
  act upon will be able to publish the measured data
- The actors that have the expertise in interpreting and synthesizing the
  performanace data will be able to publish the results of the interpetation /
  synthesis
- The actors that act upon the interpretation are 

### Security and privacy considerations

Preserving the privacy of the end users is a hard requirement. There is an intrinsic tradeoff between collecting more data about the activities of the users, and infringing their privacy.


### Concrete suggestsions

- The TCP protocol makes several metrics available for the passive measurement,
  and the following metrics were found effective:
  - TCP connection latency using SACK/ACK measurements, as well as the timing
    between the TCP retransmission events, are good proxies for the end-to-end
    RTT.
  - On Linux platform, the tcp_info structure is the de-facto standard for the
    application to introspect the performance of kernel-space networking. There
    is no equivalent de-facto standard for the user-space networking.
- The QUIC/MASQUE protocols make passive performance measurment more difficult.
  For these protocols, an approach that uses federated measurement /
  hierarchical aggregation appears more valuable. 
  - The QLOG format seems to be the most mature candidate for souch exchange.


Security, privacy and data protections considerations make the cross-layer 
The participants agreed that observability across multiple layers is necessary for measurement of the network quality.


One sentiment shared by sevearal participants is that 


## Synthesis

Finally, in the Synthesis section presentations and discussions
concentrated on the next steps likely needed to make forward
progress. Of particular concern is how to bring forward measurements
that can make sense to end users trying to make subscription
decisions.

# Conclusions

During the final hour of the workshop we gathered statements that the
group thought were summary statements from the 3 day event.  We later
discarded any that were in contention (listed further below for
completeness).  For this document, the editor took the original list
and divided it into rough categories, applied some suggested edits
discussed on the mailing list and further edited for clarity and to
provide context.

## General statements

1. Bandwidth is necessary but not alone sufficient.
2. In many cases, Internet users donât need more bandwidth, but rather
   need "better bandwidth" -- i.e., they need other improvements to
   their connectivity.
3. We need both active and passive measurements â passive measurements
   can provide historical debugging.
4. We need passive measurements to be continuous and archivable and
   queriable â include reliability/connectivity measurements.
5. A really meaningful metric for users is whether their application
   will work properly or fail because of a lack of a network with
   sufficient characteristics.
6. A useful metric for goodness must actually incentive goodness --
   good metrics should be actionable to help drive industries toward
   improvement.
7. A lower latency Internet, however achieved would benefit all end
   users.

## Specific statements about detailed protocols/techniques

8. Round trips Per Minute (RPM) is a useful, consumable metric.
9. We need a usable tool that fills the current gap between network
   reachability, latency, and speed tests.
10. End-users that want to be involved in QoS decisions should be able
    to voice their needs and desires.
11. Applications are needed that can perform and report good quality
    measurements in order to identify insufficient points in 
    network access.
12. Research done by regulators indicate that users/consumers prefer
    a simple metric per application, which frequently resolves to
    whether the application will work properly or not.
13. New measurements and QoS or QoE techniques should not rely only or
    depend on reading TCP headers.
10. It is clear from developers of interactive applications and from
    network operators that lower latency is a strong factor in user
    QoE.  However, metrics are lacking to support this statement
    directly.

## Problem statements and concerns

15. Latency mean and medians are distractions from better measurements.
16. It is frustrating to only measure network services without
    simultaneously improving those services.
17. Stakeholder incentives arenât aligned for easy wins in this space.
    Incentives are needed to motivate improvements in public network
    access.  Measurements may be one step toward driving competitive
    market incentive.
18. For future-proof networking, it is important to measure the
    ecological impact of material and energy usage.
19. We do not have incontrovertible evidence that any one metric
    (e.g., latency or speed) is more important than others to persuade
    device vendors to concentrate on any one optimization.

## No-consensus reached statements

Additional statements were recorded that did not have consensus of the
group at the time, but we list them here for completeness about the fact
they were discussed:

1. We do not have incontrovertible evidence that buffer bloat is a
   prevalent problem.
2. The measurement needs to support reporting localization in order to
   find problems.  Specifically:
    - Detecting a problem is not sufficient if you canât find the location.
    - Need more than just English â different localization concerns.
3. Stakeholder incentives arenât aligned for easy wins in this space.

# Follow-on work

There was discussion during the workshop about where future work
should be performed.  The group agreed that some work could be done
more immediately within existing IETF working groups (e.g. IPPM,
DetNet and RAW), while other longer-term research may be needed in
IRTF groups.

# Security considerations

A few security relevant topics were discussed at the workshop,
including but not limited to:

- What prioritization techniques can work without invading the privacy
  of the communicating parties.
- How oversubscribed networks can essentially be viewed as a DDoS
  attack.
